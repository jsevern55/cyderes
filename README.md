GET API for retrieving Whois Data for a single hard coded ipv6 address: https://t7mg5e3a94.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getWhoisData

Ideally, I would've added support to pass an IPv6, IPv4, & domain name. Additionally, I would've liked to add GeoIP & Virus Total data. 

Terraform + GitHub actions could not be acheived in the time allotted.
